- remastered the teepee village (wooded badlands). The camp now includes actual loot, more detailed yurts and in general more color; (color / colour?)

- removed stony shore from the list of potential biomes a structure can spawn in (this is mostly for Terralith rather than vanilla);
- added more bugs to fix later.

1.2 - Upgrades, people, upgrades! (part I)

- fixed broken chests with set loot and/or no loot in a couple of outposts;
- fixed wooded badlands outpost using the sparse jungle outpost structure pieces;
- removed bugged structures and unused template pools where necessary;

- removed snowy taiga outpost. Now the fire lookout tower will spawn in both normal and snowy taiga biomes;
- replaced the oak tree in the grove outposts with a spruce tree to better fit in with the surrounding landscape;
- replaced the more_structures namespace with towns_and_towers namespace.

1.02 - The Terralith Update

- paired the pack with Terralith. Now, structures from the pack will also spawn in the new Terralith biomes, along with the vanilla biomes
- new exclusive structures spawn if Terralith is installed. They have the *exclusive* prefix when previewing /locate

The pack of course still works on its own, as well as with other structure packs.
